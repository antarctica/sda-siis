# Todo:
 [ ] - Measurements and routes panel. 
 [ ] - Refine styles for programmatic map layers
 [ ] - Health check of mobile app display and functionality
 [ ] - handle refreshing and resyncing layers regularly.
 [ ] - refactor the accordion code - should be its own component.
 [ ] - Rewrite sprite code to be generated from svg directory as a separate build step.
 [ ] - delete old key value store.
 
Routes Plan:
[ ] - Create a button for importing a route from a file. 
[ ] - when a route is imported them it should be converted into valid geojson. 
[ ] - the geojson should be displayed on the map. 
[ ] - There should be an option to draw a new route on the map. 
[ ] - The user should be able to export the route to a file as geojson or rtzp. 

The user interface should be designed to create different pathways of interaction.
